**New 'config flow' component**.


> WARNING: If you are updating from a previous version you should delete any configuration text related with this integration from your `configuration.yaml`, since `yaml configuration` is now **NOT supported**.


This release maintains the basic funcionality of the previous one, but much of the code was rewriten in order to make it easier a further (more advanced) integration. It uses a new version of the API with a new algorithm for `alert_id`.

A very useful set of automations were added to [documentation][1].
