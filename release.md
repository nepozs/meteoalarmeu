**This is a *config flow* component**.


> WARNING: If you are updating from a previous version you should delete any configuration text related with this integration from your `configuration.yaml`, since *yaml configuration* is now **NOT supported** and this integration will **STOP to work (if you don't do it)**!.

Main changes:
1. This release improves the user experience when configuring the component.
2. Fixed the **bug #10** and now **Bulgaria should use** as its language `bg` (ISO 639-1 code).

A very useful set of automations are in the [documentation][1]. You can have more like these by consulting the [HA Forum][2].
